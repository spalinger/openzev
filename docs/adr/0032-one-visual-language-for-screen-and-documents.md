# ADR 0032: One visual language for screen and documents

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-08
- Amends: ADR 0014 (decision 1: separate screen and print typefaces; the "PDF-only" document anatomy)
- Related specs: `2026-08-ui-redesign-pdf-style` (baseline), `2026-04-frontend-management-page-design` (reference)

## Context

ADR 0014 made the app and its documents share tokens, brand and chart palette,
but deliberately not their layout grammar or typeface: the screen kept Inter,
print kept "Helvetica Neue". On the server, neither Helvetica nor Helvetica
Neue is installed, so every PDF actually rendered in Liberation Sans (an Arial
metric clone), with chart labels falling back to Noto Sans. The two surfaces
read as relatives rather than as one product:

- The invoice's most recognisable elements — the document header with its
  hairline and short forest rule, sections opened by a forest dot, figure tiles
  (kicker label, figure, small unit, one dark accent tile), the sage status pill
  — appeared nowhere in the app.
- The app's own chrome had drifted toward a generic dashboard: floating cards
  with large shadows, cards nested in cards for every list record, a solid
  primary button in every row, a top-right account card that cost a band of
  vertical space on every page, a sidebar whose 150px logo pushed navigation
  below the fold at 900px height.
- Two of the five document templates (annual statement, tax overview) predated
  the shared PDF base and used their own header, centred tiles and a static
  footer.

## Decision

1. **One typeface.** Inter is the face of the app and of every generated
   document. The backend images install Debian's `fonts-inter` (static OTFs,
   embedded as CFF subsets in PDF/A-3b); `design/tokens.json`
   `type.fontFamily.print` leads with `Inter` and the generator emits it as
   `--font-print` (`backend/templates/pdf/_tokens.css`) and
   `_CHART_FONT_FAMILY` (chart SVG roots, which do not inherit the document
   font). The screen face is emitted as `--font-sans`. The app loads Inter's
   optical-size axis, so display sizes use the display cut. **Exception:** the
   Swiss QR-bill payment part keeps the fonts its standard permits (the `qrbill`
   SVG renders in Liberation Sans).
2. **Shared anatomy, in both directions.** The document elements become the
   app's elements, and the remaining documents adopt them too:
   - *Header signature* — page headers (and dialog headers) end in a hairline
     with a short forest rule at its start, the documents' `.document-header`
     rule; the scope kicker carries the brand dot.
   - *Section heading* — sheet titles carry the forest dot of the invoice's
     section headings.
   - *Figure tiles* — KPI tiles use the documents' tile: uppercase kicker
     label, the figure with its unit set small and muted, an optional hint,
     at most one dark accent tile per view. Tiles in a row share label/figure/
     hint tracks (CSS subgrid), so figures align like a printed row.
   - *Status pill* — approved invoices wear the sage pill printed on the
     invoice; table and list pills follow its fill-plus-hairline grammar.
   - *Tables* — column labels are small uppercase kickers on a sunken band;
     money and quantities are tabular and right-aligned.
   - The annual statement and the tax overview move onto
     `pdf/shared_pdf_base.html`, which now also holds the summary band
     (recipient + facts), figure tiles, dotted sections, dark-header
     `doc-table`, `summary-box` and the running footer used by all documents.
3. **A quieter shell.** The sidebar is a white sheet with a hairline beside
   the paper workspace: a horizontal logo lockup, compact navigation that fits
   a 900px viewport, the current page as a pale forest row with a short forest
   mark, and the signed-in account at its foot (account, language, log out)
   instead of a top bar. On phones a white app bar carries the menu button and
   the lockup. Forest is kept for what matters — the current page, the primary
   action, the one accent figure — as the documents keep it for their rule,
   table headers and accent card. Sheets are white with a hairline and no
   floating shadow; depth is reserved for menus, dialogs and toasts.
4. **Lists are ledgers, actions have one weight per level.** Management lists
   (participants, metering points, tariffs) are hairline-separated rows of one
   sheet, not cards in a card. Toolbars sit on the page without a sheet. Inside
   rows, the main action is a forest outline and destructive actions are quiet
   until hovered; the page's own primary action is the only solid button, and
   confirm dialogs keep the solid red.

## Consequences

Positive:
- A participant who opens the app and then the PDF sees the same typeface,
  figures, pills, headings and rules — the documents read as printouts of the
  app, and the app as the live version of the documents.
- PDFs gain a typeface designed for screens and small sizes (tabular figures
  where the templates ask for them), and chart labels no longer fall back to a
  third face.
- Every page gains vertical room (no top bar, compact sidebar); the
  participant list is about 40% shorter; row actions no longer compete with the
  page's primary action.
- One set of document components in the PDF base instead of per-template
  copies.

Trade-offs:
- The backend image grows by the Inter OTFs (~21 MB installed). Deployments that build
  their own image must add `fonts-inter`; without it the stack falls back to
  the previous Helvetica/Arial chain and documents still render.
- Inter is wider than Liberation Sans: some long line-item descriptions wrap
  one line earlier. Page geometry (QR slip, running furniture) is unchanged.
- Stored `PdfTemplate` overrides keep their own markup; the changed shared base
  flags them stale through the existing `default_digest` check.
- The app's labels and table headers are uppercase kickers (via CSS
  `text-transform`, never in translation strings), as on the documents; they
  are kept short and set at 11px with tracking.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Keep two typefaces (ADR 0014 decision 1).** Rejected: the "print face" was
   in practice whatever metric clone the container had, and it was the single
   biggest visible difference between app and documents.
2. **Helvetica-like face on screen.** Rejected: Inter is the better screen face
   and is free to embed; moving the documents to it costs one package.
3. **Ship the font inside the templates as a `data:` URI.** Rejected: every
   render would carry ~300 KB of base64, and stored overrides would have to copy
   it; a system font keeps templates small and the fetcher policy unchanged.
4. **Keep a forest sidebar.** The first iteration of this decision made the
   sidebar the app's one dark surface. Rejected in review: the large dark
   area outweighed the content and competed with the forest accents that carry
   meaning (current page, primary action, accent figure); the documents, too,
   are white paper with forest accents.
5. **Copy the PDF layout 1:1 onto screens (a "document" app).** Rejected for the
   reasons in ADR 0014: dense operational screens need sentence-case labels in
   forms, light table bands, and no gradient chrome — the shared elements are
   the ones that carry meaning (rules, dots, tiles, pills, type), not the page
   geometry.

## Notes

- Tokens: `design/tokens.json` (`--line-strong`; semantics `--text-heading`,
  `--border-strong`, `--surface-sunken`, `--accent-rule`, `--sidebar-text`,
  `--sidebar-indicator`; field tokens 14px/500 labels, 8px radius).
- Specs: `2026-08-ui-redesign-pdf-style.md` §15, `2026-04-frontend-management-page-design.md`.
